# Task-1
1. I have already shown how to do this in the class (Recitation-7).

# Task-2
1. `play -> execute_command -> select_move -> bookB`. `bookB` has a definition but `bookA` does not. So define that.
2. `strengthB` has 3 definitions. Define `strengthA` similarly.
3. There exists `ply_depthB(3).` the depth of alpha-beta search for playerB. Define this for playerA.
4. `strengthB -> valueB`. There are 6 definition of `valueB`. Define for playerA similarly.
5. There are 3 rules for `sufficientB`. Write the same for playerA.
6. There is one rule for `collect_movesB`. Write the same for playerB.
7. Have the following order of rules -> `strength -> ply -> value -> book -> sufficient -> collect`

# Task-3
1. Remove `get_command` and call `execute_command`
