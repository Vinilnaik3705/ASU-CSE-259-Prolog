## Notes

- `is` operator helps to evaluate mathematical terms. When we use `is`, if the left of `is` is a variable then the evaluated term is binded with that variable. If on the left, there's a number, the number and the evaluated value is compared.

- `=:=` works like the `==` we use in OOP or structured programming language.
